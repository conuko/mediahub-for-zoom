# How the MediaHub for zoom works.

You simply log in, upload your media, assign titles and descriptions, and sort them in the order in which they will appear in your presentation. In the next step, you link the MediaHub to the zoom meeting via the meeting ID.
Then share the MediaHub access link with your clients before the presentation and tell them to keep the page or app open during the presentation. This works on the same device, or even better, with a second device.
For example, your client could enjoy your presentation on their laptop while watching / listening to the related media on their smartphone via the MediaHub App for zoom.
There, thanks to the zoom API, all media, as soon as they are shown in the presentation in the zoom meeting, are also highlighted in the MediaHub or, depending on the settings, played directly.
Another option is to include the entire zoom meeting in the MediaHub. The media and your zoom Meeting with the presentation are thus united in one place.
To play the media in perfect quality via the MediaHub, the meeting is then automatically muted - until the media is played.
