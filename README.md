# MediaHub for ZOOM

MediaHub for ZOOM is a simple but highly effective tool for all upcoming presentations via zoom:

You simply log in, upload your media, assign titles and descriptions, and sort them in the order in which they will appear in your presentation. 

In the next step, you link the MediaHub to the zoom meeting via the meeting ID.

I created this project as Challenge for the admission process at CODE Berlin.
